         <h1>PARAGRAPH ON YOURSELF</h1>
         <p>My name is Mahnoor, I’m the youngest member of my family, but I have several other roles to play. I’m a good and responsible daughter to my parents, a good sister to my siblings
            and a supportive and understanding friend. I set goals for myself and work hard to achieve them. I had done my Intermediate level in Engineering in 2020, and than i did web and 
            mobile app development course from UIT, there i learnd some basic of html and css. Now i want become a developer that's why i have join this course hope this course will be best 
            for me and IN SHA ALLAH soon i will become a developer. My Parents are my Strengths. They always motivate me to try new things and learn from my mistakes. A positive attitude and 
            a good sense of humor are the highlights of my strength. Instead of worrying about my mistakes, I always try to learn new things from my mistakes. And I ensure that I won’t
            repeat the same mistakes again.

          There are so many things which I would like to explore. I would like to explore each and every place on this earth and get to know about people, culture, climate, and the
          environment. I would like to explore cooking and learn how to cook. I love to play badminton. My hobbies include reading, baking and listening to music. Like everyone I too have bad
          habits, but I constantly work towards making myself better person. I would like to conclude by saying that I am the very happiest person in the world who loves to spread only 
          positivity and a colorful environment to the people around me.
